This package provides a rather thin layer of functionality over a Go map,
providing some terminology and basic functionality that implements the
mathematical concept of a multiset.

A Multiset is an unordered collection of distinct elements with a
multiplicity, or count, associated with each element.  Counts are required
to be greater than zero.
